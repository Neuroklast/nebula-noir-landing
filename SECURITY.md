## Reporting

Do not file public GitHub issues for vulnerabilities. Email the site operator (see Impressum).

## Environment variables

### Public (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)

Safe to ship to the browser:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (RLS-enforced)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HERO_VIDEO_URL`

### Secret (server only)

Never prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Never import into client components.

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — bypasses RLS; cron + admin server actions only
- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_ENDPOINT`
- `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Instagram Login user token), `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET`
- `CRON_SECRET`

`R2_PUBLIC_URL` is not a credential but is server-used when writing object URLs.

`INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` is optional documentation for the Meta dashboard; the app does not read it at runtime. `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` is for the short-lived → long-lived token exchange only (`DEPLOYMENT.md`). Complete list and comments: `.env.example`.

## Supabase RLS (see `supabase/reset.sql`)

| Table | anon | authenticated admin |
|---|---|---|
| `categories` | SELECT | ALL |
| `gallery_images` | SELECT where `published` | ALL |
| `events` | SELECT where `published` | ALL |
| `brand_info` | SELECT | ALL |
| `instagram_posts` | SELECT | SELECT (writes via service role) |
| `instagram_auth` | none | none (service role only) |
| `contact_inquiries` | INSERT | SELECT, UPDATE |
| `profiles` | none | SELECT own row; admin role set only via SQL/service |

Admin check: JWT user id exists in `profiles` with `role = 'admin'`.

Service role is used only in:

- `src/lib/supabase/service.ts`
- Instagram cron/sync route
- Never `createBrowserClient` with the service key

## R2 upload limits

- Images: max 10 MB; JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF/SVG; `gallery/{uuid}.{ext}`
- Hero video: max 80 MB; MP4/WebM/MOV; `hero/{uuid}.{ext}` via 120s presigned PUT (admin only)
- Auth: admin session required for all uploads
- No public write on the bucket; Next.js server uses S3-compatible credentials

## Cron

`/api/cron/instagram` requires `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` (or Vercel Cron header).

## Contact form

Validate name/email/message server-side. Truncate oversized payloads. RLS INSERT is not a substitute for rate limiting (add WAF/Vercel firewall in production).

## Auth

- Email/password via Supabase Auth
- Middleware gates `/admin`
- Demo Mode has no real auth; admin writes are no-ops
